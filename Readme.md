# Advent of Code 2022

## Introduction
Hello, and welcome to the code repository for my attempt at Advent of Code 2022. Here you'll find all of my entries, written in Python 3.10 and labelled according to the "day" that they correspond to. Some of the second-half sections of the puzzles were solvable with a single algorithm, whereas others required significant reworks of the original concepts and were separated out into their own "-2" files.

## Why take part in AoC?
I've primarily taken part in Advent of Code to show my Python skills and advertise my programming talents. In addition, the AoC challenges are great for improving understanding of certain programming topics, including:
- Algorithms
- Runtime efficiency
- Problem solving via code

## What's being worked on?
Currently, I am working on Day 13, part 1.
